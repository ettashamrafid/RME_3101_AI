# AI Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the AI Algorithms repository! This collection of Python programs provides implementations of various artificial intelligence algorithms for solving a wide range of problems. These algorithms include Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Minimax, Expectimax, A* (A-star), and Markov Decision Processes (MDP).

## Table of Contents

1. [**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**](#breadth-first-search-bfs): A graph traversal algorithm that explores all neighbor nodes at the current depth before moving to the next level.
2. [**Depth-First Search (DFS)**](#depth-first-search-dfs): A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
3. [**Minimax Algorithm**](#minimax-algorithm): A decision-making algorithm used in two-player games to minimize the possible loss.
4. [**Expectimax Algorithm**](#expectimax-algorithm): A variation of the minimax algorithm that accounts for uncertain outcomes and chance nodes.
5. [**A* (A-star) Search**](#a-a-star-search): A heuristic-based search algorithm used to find the shortest path in a graph.
6. [**Markov Decision Processes (MDP)**](#markov-decision-processes-mdp): A mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations with uncertainty.

## Usage
